    name: Ensure separate partition exists for /tmp
    description:
      The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users
      and some applications.
    rationale:
      Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource
      exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file
      system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless
      for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from
      establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the
      program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own
      copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker
      could continue to exploit the known flaw.

    name: Ensure cron daemon is enabled
    description: The cron daemon is used to execute batch jobs on the system.
    rationale:
      While there may not be user jobs that need to be run on the system, the system does have
      maintenance jobs that may include security monitoring that have to run, and cron is used
      to execute them
